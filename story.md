# Layout
The layout of the tomb corresponds to the stages of Abari's life.

* Earth - Animations.
 * Abari in his youth.
* Power - Fire, magic.
 * Abari becoming stronger.
* Water - Water.
 * Abari learning about peace.
* Life - Lush forest.
 * Abari working healing magic.
* Insanity - Twisted monstrosities.
 * Abari overcome.
* Death - The undead / slaughter.
 * Abari dead.

## Insanity
Morri is taken from Zeth, rejected by the Tomb of Abari. After continuing a while, Zeth finds an exit. He can either leave the cave and search for Morri, or continue in his task and face Abari's corpse.

## Death
### Slaughter
The Tomb of Abari and all it's living power comes to kill Zeth after he escapes without facing Abari. He must slaughter all life to rescue Morri, who is being held by the elves.

#### Exhaustion
The Tomb collapses and Zeth must fight his way out of the Valley of Life as undead rise up and disperse in chaotic writhing.

### Entombed
Zeth must battle the undead portion of the Tomb to capture Abari's body.

#### Emergence
When Zeth emerges into the light, he must fight his way through the crumbling remains of the Valley of Life. Morri is barely alive, he must rescue her (some negative trait to indicate this).

## Finale
If Zeth has Abari's body, Cain declares his confidence in him. Morri praises his commitment to the mission. He is considered a strong candidate to become a pupil of Sha Javia and learn true, ruthless power.
If Zeth does not have the body (but an unharmed Morri), Morri is very happy. Cain indicates that he trusts his decisions. He is considered to succeed Cain in the management of Thar-Nella's magi.

# Characters
* Zeth - Young mage, still learning advanced techniques. He trusts his masters, but only because they have not made visible mistakes.
* Morri - Older servant of Thar-Nella, Cain's pupil from some years ago. She has full faith in Thar-Nella and Cain.
* Cain - Extremely old wizard, aspiring to become a lich.

# Questions
* Why does Cain want Abari's body? To correct his mistake of simply buring him deep below the ground after killing him. He tried to hide his "crime".
* Why did he send Zeth and Morri? Morri is his assistant, Zeth is his last direct pupil and subordinate.
